At its core, ARPiano provides a framework for extending a physical piano using augmented reality. ARPiano is able to precisely locate a physical keyboard in order to overlay various objects around the keyboard and on individual keys. These augmented objects are then used for music learning, visualization and understanding. Furthermore, ARPiano demonstrates a novel way to utilize the keys in a piano as an interface to interact with various augmented objects.",
